what it says on the tin, it's a fallout terminal cracker.

instruction:

1 - find a terminal in a game of fallout, launch the program
2 - input every word you see inside the terminal minigame into the program, each one in a separate line. the last line should just be "."
3 - the program outputs a word, input that word into the terminal and input the number of correct letters into the program

repeat step 3 until the password to the terminal is found or until the program finishes

the success rate is approaching 100% since the program hasn't failed a single time out of ~200 terminals it's been tested on
